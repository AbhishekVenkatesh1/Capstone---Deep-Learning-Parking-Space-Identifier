# Capstone---Deep-Learning-Parking-Space-Identifier
Capstone project at Lawrence University called Park Vision.

Deep learning application to optimize open parking space identification.

Parking Lot class incorporates computer vision algorithm utilizing Python and OpenCV to locate individual parking spaces.

Model file creates a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras to efficiently predict availability of each parking space.

Constructed Flask web app that allows users to upload parking lot images and outputs image of open spaces in the given parking lot.
